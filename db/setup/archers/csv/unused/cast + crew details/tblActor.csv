150,"Margot",,"Boyd","09/24/13 00:00:00","05/20/08 00:00:00","Birthplace and date: 24 09 1913, Bath Education: RADA Margot Boyd's career before making her own, the role of the robust countrywoman Mrs Antrobus, in The Archers has introduced her to the great names of theatre and film: George Bernard Shaw, Noel Coward, Michael Redgrave, Vivian Leigh, James Stewart, Kenneth More  
But she traces her early interest in acting to one of her first childhood memories - that of soldiers marching by the front door of the family home in Bath. The infant Margot used to run beside them, trying to make them laugh, until her mother would appear to gently usher her back indoors. Her family loved the theatre and talked about it a lot, and at a time when families had to entertain each other, Margot was encouraged in her recitations. The delighted response gave her the first thoughts of going into the theatre, though she admits that at first, her father would have preferred her to find a job where a pension would be guaranteed.
These early thoughts of a theatrical life were re-reinforced by her school: regular visits to the Old Vic developed her love of Shakespeare, and she was inspired by watching the performances of Sir John Gielgud, Dame Peggy Ashcroft, Michael Redgrave and Noel Coward (""a marvellous man""), with whom she would subsequently work,
A gold medal for her work spurred on Margot's application to RADA. She was successful. Her parents, she recalls, though shocked, were very supportive, and soon she found herself in a play produced by George Bernard Shaw. She describes him as ""wonderful - very encouraging"": he adored actors and acting, and worked hard to enable everyone to get the best from the opportunity. Leaving RADA, Margot immediately got a job in rep at Leeds Theatre Royal, twice nightly playing a leading lady, which she recalls never seemed to involve a part under the age of 55. Leeds gave her the opportunity to play in all the productions from the West End, and introduced her to that long-vanished institution, the theatrical digs. Margot's £2. 1 Os weekly lodgings provided her with four meals a day, a roaring fire lit before she rose in the mornings, and waiting for her at lunchtime and at night - and she could bring ffiends back after the performance and a meal would be provided for all. It was as a member of the BBC Repertory Company in 1984 that Margot had her first encounter with Mrs Antrobus. A note in her file asked her to travel to Birmingham for a one-off appearance. But Margot noticed the production staff seemed to be laughing afterwards - and it was not long before a telephone call from them asked if she would like to make Mrs Antrobus a regular part.She knew, by her own admission ""not a loC about Radio 4's famous drama of life in Ambridge. There was some personal experience to draw on in working with the role: Margot's father had looked after a big country estate, and at one time she'd been a regular visitor to Crufts. She says she has to have seen the person she portrays, and to have met them, so from this early observation in the Somerset countryside (where ""every other woman was a Mrs Antrobus') and at Crufts, has come much of the detail of the Afghan-breeding Mrs Antrobus.Margot puts these major moves in her career down to luck: citing as an example her move to Stratford in 1953 to work with Michael Redgrave. The season finished and Redgrave put on Noel Coward's Waiting in the Wings, and Margot, much to her surprise, was given the leading role. When the production moved to Dublin, Coward (already in his late sixties) was there for four weeks, and the two became and remained firm friends.Her colleagues in The Archers remain fascinated with the detail of Margot's career: she had her own series ""Our Miss Pemberton "" in the early days of television; her formidable list of credits includes Middlentarch, Dixon ofDock Green with Jack Warner, The Forty Nine Steps with Kenneth More; even stage managing The Ghost Train at The Criterion where, she admits, she once pressed the button to move the train long before its due time, and caused chaos at the dress rehearsal.For the past 30 years Margot has lived in London's Earl's Court, still enjoying her visits to theatres, the cinemas and galleriesm, and commuting to the Birmingham studios to brings to life one of the classic characters created for The Archers.
