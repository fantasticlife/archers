Caroline has always hunted. Her horse is Maisie.
The Hunt keep the dogs at Netherbourne Hall in Netherbourne. Lord (Adrian) Netherbourne is Caroline’s uncle.
Shula and Alistair. Shula is a keen huntswoman, owns the stables and rides every day.  Alistair less so, but he is supportive of Shula and has said that he would not enjoy having to put down the hounds if hunting was banned.
Christine was a keen hunter but due to age and a bad back she no longer rides.
Debbie hunts her horse is called Tolly.
Alice is keen her horse is Spearmint. 
Adam rides and he did hunt as a child.
Brian did ride to hounds in 1978 but hasn’t done so for years.
Jennifer doesn't like horses that much, and doesn't ride, however she supports hunting.
Helen hunted as a child and is supportive of the hunt.
Nigel has acted as whipper - in.  
It’s years since Elizabeth has ridden, she did take some lessons when Cameron invited her to join him, hunting. The hunt ball has been held at Lower Loxley and the hunt meet there. 
Graham Ryder hunts for social reasons, but is not a good horseman. 
Susan has friends, Carl and Sandra who work for the hunt; Carl is a huntsman and Sandra's a groom, they would be out of work if hunting was banned, it would also make a difference to Christopher’s employment prospects. 
Neil helped Greg put up pro hunting posters. 
Lilian hunts and has tried to get Matt on to a horse – something his wife never managed to do. If he could ride, Matt would hunt for social reasons. 
Jack is happy for the hunt to go across his land. 
On the Fence: As the hunt sometimes meet at The Bull, Sid and Jolene would rather not rock the boat. 
Alan has admitted to a dislike of hunting however he is his insistent that others have the right to do as they choose.
Ed was certainly no great hunt supporter, but he was willing to take on the casual job while Carl was unwell. However when Fallon harangued him about working for the hunt, he felt hard done by.
Joe happy to support the hunt, when it’s to his advantage, and moan about them being posh when that suits his mood. 
Anti: - Pat and Tony are both anti hunting. Lynda is anti. Although she has been a country woman for years, Jill is very anti hunting. Last year Tom and Kirsty tore down pro hunting posters.  Jazzer got beaten-up by Greg for removing pro-hunting posters. Fallon sounded off to Ed about the cruelty and pointlessness of hunting.
Amy is anti. Freda isn’t keen. 
South Borsetshire Hunt: - In the kennel they have 16 and a half couple dogs, 18 and a half couple bitches which they keep separated. Hounds names are taken from an old traditional list, the first letter has to be the same as the sire or dam. They are fed flesh on hunting days. Three of the dogs are called:  Groucho, Grappler, Grapefruit.","11/23/04 10:28:21","11/23/04 10:28:21","fishec50","fishec50"

Dear Mrs Grundy
The Food Hygiene England Regulations 2006
The Health Protection (Part 2A) Regulations 2010
I can confirm that we have now completed our investigation into an Ecoli O157 outbreak associated with the consumption of ice cream from the Bridge Farm dairy. The source of the bacteria appears to be post pasteurisation contamination of the ice cream. The same type of Ecoli O157 was isolated by microbiological experts from a faecal sample that you produced. The onset of your symptoms, and the details of your food handling whilst symptomatic would lead me to conclude that you may have caused contamination of the ice cream. Ecoli O157 can survive in ice cream and may have led to the associated cases who consumed this product.
Whilst I am satisfied that you did not deliberately set out to ignore the exclusion advice given by the owners of the premises, I am sure you are aware of the very grave consequences of your actions in a serious outbreak of a serious disease.
I am unable to take legal proceedings against you in this instance but if you continue to work in a food handling environment you will require re-training.
Failure to adhere to the requirements of the Food Hygiene legislation in future will result in legal action.
Yours sincerely
Adrian Pegg
