35,"Cricket Single Wicket","The actual rules are the same as for any game of cricket in terms of runs, ways of getting out etc. Single wicket refers not to the stumps (a common misconception) but to the fact that it is a knockout competition involving individuals rather than teams. After round one, eight players remain and so on until two players are left to contest the final. Sometimes, the semi-finals and final will comprise three and four overs respectively.  Fielding is done by the other players on a rotational basis. So while player A plays player B, ten of the others will  field (including a wicket keeper). The other four (usually the two pairs involved in the next two games) will get ready to play, put pads on, do the score book, do the umpiring and make the teas. Except in Ambridge, where they always have an umpire and someone to do the teas.

61,"Football","Quote from the fixture list of 1976-7 ""After home games the team will adjourn to the Bull where they will provide their visitors with a snack and a pint. Sid will probably set aside a special room for this. Injuries are rife at this level of kick-about soccer. Among the younger players it will be bruises and strains or sheer battle fatigue. It is rare that a team survives a season without the odd broken leg or nose, and at least one member will be unavailable through injury each week. Wives are notoriously unsympathetic to these sporting mishaps.""","02/11/99 00:00:00","03/25/09 16:34:23","DataEase","fishec50"

171,"Shula's IVF","Archive note
Shula and Mark married  (after some hesitation) in September 1985.  Eighteen months later and she thought she might be pregnant, but the test result was negative.  Both Shula and Mark were relieved as it was too soon to start a family.
A year later in January 1988 and they decided that the time was right and told Jill that they were thinking of babies.  By November no babies had appeared  - so Mark had a word with the doctor.
In January 1989 Shula had been through the Well Woman Clinic process and everything seemed fine.  However she avoided the next step - the gynaecologist - because she was worried what they might tell her.  This caused problems in their marriage and by March, Mark had moved out.
They were reconciled and Shula made her appointment with the gynaecologist, which was followed by a Laparoscopy in April ‘89.
Shula had endometriosis, but as soon that that was cleared up everything should be fine again.  By February still no baby and they were trying.
Then in October 1990 Shula became pregnant - at last - she was very happy. November and she had suffered sharp pains in her side - the pregnancy was ectopic.  Shula had to have the baby terminated and she lost a fallopian tube.
Worse off than ever and in May 1992 Lizzie gets pregnant.  Shula starts to entertain fanaticises about adopting the baby and bring it up as her own.  Elizabeth has an abortion and  Shula is devastated.
She and Mark agree to look into IVF by March 1993 they have their first appointment and then in May her eggs are harvested and in June they are implanted.  Shula gets pregnant but not for long  - she has a miscarriage. Sad Shula has to recover before she can have a second go.
February 1994 and they have their second attempt at IVF. But before they are able to find out if the eggs have taken, Mark is killed in a car accident.
On her doctor’s (Richard) advice, Shula continues  the injections and in November 1994 Daniel is born.","02/11/99 00:00:00","10/29/99 12:51:29","DataEase","FISHEC50"

She  suffered from morning sickness and needed time off work.  The smell of stale flower water made her feel queasy and she took to drinking tea, not something she normally did.  Jill became suspicious. Jill asked Elizabeth if she was pregnant and she had to admit she was, but she swore Jill to secrecy at least until she had had time to tell Cameron. 23/3/92 Because of Jill’s insistence Liz tells Phil. He tells her that she doesn’t have to marry ""that man"" if she doesn’t want to.  He even offers to tell Cameron himself, but no, she wants to do it. On 26/3/92 Elizabeth tells Cameron, without asking her what she wanted to do he offers to pay for her to have an abortion.  Liz is very upset she had wanted him to be happy. She tells him she is going to keep the baby. Because of the sickness Lizzie tells Nigel about the baby on 30/3/92 he is supportive and starts to talk about maternity leave. She begins to see that her future is not as rosy as she had always assumed it would be.  The following week she tells David and Ruth. David is not understanding and tells her that she has been very irresponsible, and how are Jill and Phil going to feel if their first grandchild is illegitimate.  Cameron tries to tell her more about his financial difficulties but she claims she has faith in him. The family are putting off telling Shula, because of all the problems she is having in getting pregnant.  It’s Cameron who lets the cat out of the bag, assuming Shula already knows.  She is upset that the family felt she couldn’t cope.Liz and Cameron make plans to go away together and she decides not to tell her parents until she is at the airport.  On the way to the airport Cameron abandons her. On 11/5/92 Elizabeth went into Birmingham alone and had her baby aborted.  She was about 14 weeks pregnant.  Cameron still doesn’t know that Elizabeth had an abortion.","03/10/99 16:39:23","03/10/99 17:45:36","fishec50","fishec50"

George was unhappy, he had made a bad choice in his marriage and a bad  choice in his first career. He left the police when he was in his late 20’s, his marriage to Ellen was already difficult. Ellen did her best to save their marriage (partly because she was a Roman Catholic) their Son Terry was born in 1960 and his sister in Karen in 1962.  But their relationship seemed doomed from the start. 
George became a keeper when he was almost 30 and he is just about to take retirement at the age of 70.","08/09/99 17:09:20","11/04/04 15:50:15","fishec50","fishec50"

440,"History of The Archers","This extract was taken from the Radio Times May 1950. - "" Some time ago, while he was turning over in his mind the possibility of a fresh approach to farming broadcasts, mainly with the aim of arousing the interest of the general listening public in a farmer's life, and his everyday problems, Godfrey Baseley conceived the idea of a short daily programme built around a fictional farming family, and telling a story in some ways similar to Mrs Dale's Diary. He thought his might hold the attention of the country people and townsfolk alike, and the programme planners supported his opinion.
The next job was to find scriptwriters capable of producing a daily piece of this kind which, in addition to being absolutely correct on agricultural technicalities, would have colour, dramatic interest, and human appeal.  At this point the Dick Barton team, Edward J Mason and Geoffrey Webb, the latter a farmer's son, came into the picture, and theirs is to be the task of writing, in dialogue form, the story which Baseley will produce.
There is now to be a trial run of five consecutive episodes (from Monday to Friday at four o'clock).  If the results prove as successful as hoped, the doings of The Archers will become daily fare (week-ends excepted) in the Autumn. Maybe their domestic adventures and misadventures will make them familiar and loveable personalities in much the same way as the characters clustered round Mrs Dale, or The Robinson Family. There will be the slight difference, however, that in this serial genuine difficulties known to every farmer, will be pegs on which the story hangs.  Country people will recognise these at once- and may even learn a little from the way The Archers set about tackling them - while the people of the towns will not find the entertainment in any way obscured by the various contretemps which take place. Indeed because people are normally interested in other people's jobs, these should lend verisiltude to the sequence of events. There will be no attempts to plug farming problems; they will come out naturally in the episodes.
The Archers are a very ordinary family, running a smallish farm. Father is a farmer of the old school, rather old0fashioned and stubborn; mother, a little better educated, has the business head and holds both farm and family together.  The three children are very dissimilar from each other.  The elder son has never really settled down after his life in the Army, and he and his town-bred wife don't always get on well together.  Both the younger son and the daughter appear to have more stability of character and are intent on getting the best education for themselves that they can.  The other characters are mainly village people.""","05/25/00 11:09:07","05/25/00 11:47:35","fishec50","fishec50"

568,"Jennifer and Brian","Before she  married Brian - Jennifer and the children (Adam and Debbie) lived with Chris and Paul at Wynford’s farm.  Paul was often away due to his work.
Brian’s  stag  night was at Grey Gables with Phil and Tony and some others who happened to be in the bar.  He got very drunk and Tony had to dive him home - the party was on the Wednesday with the wedding on the Saturday.  On Friday Jennifer and Brian went for a walk on Heden Berrow. It was very romantic, they told each other that they loved each other.  Brian told Jennifer about the plans he had for the children, and their future family life together.
Jennifer and Brian were married on a Saturday 29/5/76. At Borchester Registry Office.
Jennifer might have liked a church wedding  (the vicar was disappointed he couldn’t marry her)but as a divorced woman it had to be a civil ceremony.  She also felt the  children were too young to understand, they had only just got used to the idea that Roger wasn’t coming back. 
It was a very quiet wedding.  The only guests were; Tony and Pat, Chris (Paul was at work) and Peggy. 
The wedding was reported by Tony to have been; plain, simple and dignified.
During the service the children were with Dan and Doris and stayed with Chris while the couple were on their honeymoon.  
The holiday was also simple - a week in the Cambridge area.  Brian was worried about leaving the farm for any longer, even though he had a manager, and Jennifer wanted to get back to the children.
Pat and Tony gave them an ironing board, Chris and Paul; wine glasses, Doris and Dan cutlery.   
This was Jennifer’s second marriage, her first wedding had also been at Borchester Registry Office.","04/04/01 11:57:11","10/28/11 14:58:12","fishec50","fishec50"

However the initial pursuing was all done by Elizabeth - there were people in the village who went as far as to say - she threw herself at him. Yet her allure, youth and beauty soon won him over.  
At the hunt ball in January 1992 that Cameron first discovered he had a rival - Nigel. Initially Nigel’s attentions just put Cameron in a strop.  It was then he realised that he wanted to be with Elizabeth more than without her. So he started to fight back. Flattery and flowers were the order of the day. 
Cameron arranged a mysterious trip and drove Elizabeth to the Beachy Head. Standing beside the car with the wind blowing in their hair Cameron played his ace. 
He told her that because his father worked abroad he had been sent to a boarding school in Edinburgh.  Abandoned by his loved ones he even spent the school holidays with friends rather than family. He felt uncared for. Then when he got his first job working in the city he fell in love with a beautiful undergraduate. For two years he wooed her. Her father even offered him a job. But when he asked her to marry him she laughed in his face. Hurt Cameron became guarded - now he simply wouldn’t give his heart away. But with Lizzie he had found someone he could talk to. Cameron played the vulnerable card and it worked Elizabeth’s life was changed forever.","05/02/02 14:48:23","04/20/10 14:59:20","fishec50","fishec50"

June 2004 Christopher takes GCSE’s July / August  Christopher works with Ronnie the ATF
September Ronnie is sent a letter from the Farrier Training Service asking whether he has a candidate to propose for apprenticeship.   
End of September The FTS send out a medical questionnaire. 
Beginning of October the FTS send an application form which Ronnie then sends back.(Application  intake closes middle of October
November : Ronnie and Christopher go to the FTS in Peterborough, name the college they want to go to, and they are then later notified of acceptance. 
January 2005 There is then a 2 month probationary period when Christopher would continue working with Ronnie.  He can now do some work on the horses hooves. The probationary period is in place so that if the apprentice/ATF feel they cannot work together for 4 years 2 months, they can withdraw from the agreement now, before the apprentice starts the course proper.  
Middle of Feb 2005 (After 6 weeks into the probationary period)  they go back Peterborough to confirm that the arrangement is working.  The documentation relating to the NVQ/advanced modern apprenticeship, and the documentation regarding Grant aid funding is completed and issues.  Finally the ATF and Apprentice sign undertakings to confirm their wish to continue with the reminder of the Period of Apprenticeship. 
March  7th 2005 : Christopher starts his official training.    He begins with a month at the college before going back to work with Ronnie for a further 6 months, In October he goes back to college for another month. 
May/June 2009   When Christopher has completed his apprenticeship and got his NVQ he still has another examination and practical test to join the worshipful company of farriers.","04/02/04 12:08:53","07/15/11 14:38:47","fishec50","fishec50"

889,"Cider Club","Cider-making with the Chideock cider-making club in their barn
Two areas of work. A wooden-sided trough, about waist high, closed at one end, open at the other. Apples emptied from plastic sacks (empty feed bags) into trough. Two guys on chairs with large metal choppers (long handle, wide blade at 90 degrees to it) chopped the apples roughly. They were then shovelled into an adapted garden shredder (One man poking round the top with a wooden stick to stop it blocking). the pulp comes out into plastic tubs - salt lick type.  Any spillage swept up and put back into trough.
Buckets carried to:
The press. Already three cakes made when I got there. A cake is made by laying a large piece of hessian  over an adjustable wooden frame and filling it with approx 12 buckets of pulp. The hessian is then folded over the top and the wooden frame raised ready to take the next cake. Juice starts trickling into the base of the press and running out of a hole into a large half-tub underneath (from where the juice is pumped to huge plastic barrels)
  The pulp is spread around the hessian so as to build walls against the sides of the frame first, and then filled in.

When eight cakes had been made,  the cheese is complete, so two hand-turned flywheels on the top of the two metal threads or screws, were turned by two of the guys, pressing down on the cakes. Juice poured into the tub and they had to moderate their speed to not overwhelm the pump. A spirit level is laid on top of the board , to make sure that the beams being brought to bear on the board and cakes is level.

As the board squeezes down further, two poles are slotted through the flywheels, to increase the pressure the guys can bring down on the cheese.
When the 150 gallon container is filled with juice, the process stops.
The press is dismantled and the exhausted cheese cleared the following day. The waste pulp is fed to pigs or other livestock. Dave said that pheasants love it - so it’s a good way to tempt them off shoot land onto your own land.
Once the process is complete, everyone settled down to glasses of earlier vintage cider/bread, cheese and onions.","12/02/04 17:08:19","08/16/11 11:47:14","fishec50","fishec50"

1063,"Jack's accident"," Jack was in the habit of taking his, much loved dog Captain, for a mile and a half walk every day. One afternoon, in March, their walk had been delayed because Nigel was trying to sell Jack a swimming pool. A bored Captain decided to climb out of the large window in Jack’s office and onto the flat roof, above the kitchen.  Jack worried that the dog might slip; scramble out after him, followed by Nigel, intent on rescuing Jack. 
In the kafuffle, Jack slipped and fell, Captain was about to pursue his master, when Nigel managed to grab him. Jack landed on a flowerbed, nevertheless he lost consciousness. Nigel called the ambulance and Jack was taken to hospital.  It was over 24 hours before he came too. Jack had suffered a hairline fracture of the skull.  The next day Jack was still a little non-compos mentis and rambling about someone called Ginger. It turned out Ginger was a dog he had when he was about 12 and in his confusion he had muddled the two dogs. By the beginning of April Jack was back home at Grey Gables, worryingly his memory still had a few blanks. To cheer him up Laura gave him a jar of rosehip jelly and Peggy sent him flowers as did Caroline. However Caroline pretended that her flowers had been sent by Hazel. In fact his daughter hadn’t even bothered to send a card.","12/08/06 16:59:09","12/11/06 11:52:16","fishec50","fishec50"

That the right of occupation of the hall will be with Elizabeth, and the income of the trust during her lifetime. But under the terms of the will, Nigel directed his trustees that the estate will effectively pass to Freddie.  Lily will receive monetary assets at the appropriate time. Because Elizabeth’s got a life interest, there will be no inheritance tax on Nigel's death,  ultimately the assets will go as Nigel intended. For tax purposes that’s treated as if it’s a lifetime gift effectively from Elizabeth, and as long as she lives a further 7 years - then that will also avoid inheritance tax. This is perfectly legitimate tax planning.  If Elizabeth dies: Nigel left a letter of wishes with the trustees and the intention is for the trustees to use their discretion to make a transfer (effectively a gift) from the trust to Freddie and to Lily when they think the time’s right. Not when they’re children, but in 10 or 15 years' time.  (not on air).","01/27/11 14:48:00","10/09/13 12:37:58","fishec50","fishec50"
