He was still working in  1998 when problems at work caused a delay on their holiday. Ruth, David and the children try to spend every other Christmas in Prudhoe. Solly is a keen supporter of Newcastle Football team (we don’t know his views on cricket). He is a quiet man with a garden shed, which he uses as a retreat.  He and his wife, Heather have come to Ambridge to help Ruth after the birth of both her children. When her parents are in Ambridge they stay in Brookfield Farm House.  Ruth is still very close to her mother, who writes her long and involved letters about what’s going on in the Pritchard family ( Ruth has cousins and uncles and aunts).Pip is very found of her maternal grandparents.Both parents are very proud of Ruth, (and of Solly’s success).  Their pride has on occasions embarrassed Ruth.","02/09/99 00:00:00","05/06/99 10:35:30","DataEase","fishec50"

Ned went home for his supper and someone set fire to the outbuildings at Brookfield. Luckily Ned still had his wits about him and with Water’s help they were able to get the animals out. 
The next morning they discovered that the barn, pig house and machinery shed had been destroyed.
Gossip spread around the village that Dan had set light to the buildings himself. Because he had been intending to redevelop that part of the farm and had recently increased the insurance.  
For a month the identity of the culprit remained mystery, more people became the victims of the tittle-tattle; Fred Barratt, because he didn’t get on well with Ambridge Farmers, Johnny Martin because he liked to light camp fires in the woods and brew tea.    
One afternoon in May, Frank Mead was caught red handed trying to set fire to an outhouse at The Bull. He had always been a bit of an eccentric, anti drink and all kinds of entertainment, he disapproved of his daughter working in the pub, but no one believed him capable of such violence.

“So John Briar says - You’ll curse the day that you were born, squire and so will your children’s children……..
and the Squire he says, you leave this house, John Briar.  You leave this house and never darken my door again.
And John Briar, he goes off into the storm, with the pots and pans on his belt clanking and crashing, and he rages, and he curses, and he shakes his fists at the wind, and the rain.  He goes off into the night, and his missus, she don’t know where he is.  He finds  a little hovel next to the river, where the waters are rising and crashing of the waterfall drowns his cries, and he sits, and he thinks, and all he can think is Revenge Revenge!

Well, the night is long, and his missus, she’s beside herself with worry. So she gets the Village together, and they go a-searching for John. They search through the storm, with their lanterns swinging and the rain in their faces, and at last, they remember the hovel by the river, where the shepherd sleeps at lambing time, and down they go. The river’s running high, and the waterfall is crashing down onto the rocks below, and the water’s lapping at the door of the shepherd’s hovel.  And Sarah, she goes through the door, into that damp, dark place, and there’s John Briar, lying on the floor, with his face deathly pale.  And she lifts his head and says “John! John dear, it me. It’s Sarah!” and he opens his eyes, and looks at her, and he seems far away, like, and his cracked lips open, and he whispers to her. “Revenge! Revenge!”  And with a shudder, there in that dark hovel, he dies in her arms. But the river, and the waterfall, and the wind and the rain, all seem to take up that cry.  They cry for the wrong that the squire visited upon old John Briar.  And the cry seems to ring through the very air, growing louder and louder in the wind and the rain. Revenge! Revenge!   And under the noise of the storm and the river, there’s a clanking, and a clanking, and Sarah, she knows that noise too well.  And she’s fearful. She’s fearful for what the dawn may bring.

And up at the big house  they found the old squire dead in the morning with his hair turned white as snow.  Dead in the kitchen of his great house, with every pot and  pan in the place on the floor beside him.  Some said they’d heard a strange noise in the night, and it must have been the pots and pans falling.  And if some thought otherwise, they held their peace. But if you’re walking home on a dark November night and you hear the sound of pots and pans jingling behind you, don’t look back.  It might just be old John Briar…still a-looking for the Squire.”

Joe claimed that the above was a true story that had been handed down in his family from generation to generation. Joe’s great great great great great aunt (sometimes fur sometimes five greats)  worked for old Squire Dyke as a kitchen maid and John Briar was sweet on her. Joe claimed to have a pewter tankard his aunt  gave to John Briar  - it ‘s engraved with his initials she got it back when he died.  Bert doesn’t believe him and offers to buy Joe a pint if he shows him the tankard.

Joe finds a / the tankard and shows Bert, Bert is not convinced because Joe’s initials are JG and the initials on the tankard are JB but just scratched on and the “B” is very curly. 

Joe and Bert spend the night drinking at Woodbine Cottage (Freda wanted to see the tankard).  Joe is the worse for wear.  He walks home but before he gets to Keeper’s Cottage, Bert and Ed play a trick on him by banging pots and pans together, Bert puts on a silly voice and claims to be John Briar “Revenge Revenge” is sweet.","08/23/05 12:51:56","08/23/05 12:51:56","fishec50","fishec50"

Iftikar Shah is the son of Pakistani Punjabi immigrants who arrived in the UK in the 1970s. His father was a self-made businessman who came to own a string of pound shops across Borsetshire.  All Ifty’s siblings are involved with the family business in some shape or form but Ifty’s a bit different, he’s always been the one to go against the grain and do his own thing.  Even as a child his social conscience was evident - he would steal Mother’s Pride from his dad’s shop and dole out slices to local tramps. 
He’s grown up in a chaotic, loving, extended family (the Borsetshire Shahs put the nouveau in nouveau riche!) and has inherited his father’s business brain.  However while he likes nice clothes and has a smart car, making money isn’t what he’s really about and he has made the choice not to work in the family business.  Ifty did a Maths and Business degree and now works as a maths teacher at a secondary school in Felpersham.  He also does some tutoring outside school.  While he was at University, Ifty did some youth work part-time.  He’s seen a lot of young Asian lads lose their way in life and he’s passionate about encouraging and supporting young people in any way he can. 
Ifty’s a bit of a lone wolf in his family, but he feels a strong obligation to his siblings and particularly to his mother who was widowed when he was a teenager.  His mother would like to see him settle down and has in the past nagged him to scour online Asian dating sites, but he’s always refused.  Now as the years are passing, she’d be happy to see him bring home anyone at all!
The truth is handsome Ifty has his pick of girls but he’s a commitment phobe.  He’s by no means a rat though, he’s always up front and honest about his intentions.  This doesn’t put women off however and he’s had a lot of short-term girlfriends.  Moreover he’s got an idealised image of Mrs Right, and is waiting for someone who he deems to be perfect.","10/08/12 17:13:22","10/08/12 17:13:22","fishec50","fishec50"
