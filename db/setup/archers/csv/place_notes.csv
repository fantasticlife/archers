Inside there is a Jacobean fireplace of some merit. More than one staircase. The main one having been repaired with old Church Pews found in Birmingham. The main dining room is referred to as ""The Great Dining Room"" and is used for important occasions, the other being more of a family room (during the war they had a hatch placed between it and the main kitchen but this has probably been filled in now). Large wine cellars.  The Library is neo-classical in style and was created by Lady Henrietta Pargetter in about 1770. Liz and Nigel have had their own farm house style kitchen/diner in what used to be the morning room.  The Oak room can be used as a dressing room. The Hepplewhite Chairs cannot be sold as they are held in trust to Family Heritage.  The office is on the ground floor with computer, fax, and answering machine. They have disabled toilets as well as both male and female public loos. Disabled visitors also  have access to the grounds. Upstairs there is a galleried landing and (among others) a Blue Room and a Yellow Room, the view from the yellow room is not very good. There is also a Victorian Nursery but most of Nigel and Camilla’s old toys are up in the attics which are substantial.  As are the grounds: The conservatory, which had fallen into disrepair was one of Nigel’s favourite places. The house has a terrace, a lily pond,  a quarter of an acre walled garden, three acres of formal garden with park land to the front and seven acres of former arboretum (now wood). Uncle Cedric’s folly was built in 1834. Peacocks wander free on the lawns. Car parks can be made available.
