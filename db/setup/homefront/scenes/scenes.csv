It's one meeting after another for Gabriel.  Last night's Belgian Refugee Committee meeting went well but the Mayor has asked him to speak tonight at the Call To Arms meeting at the Town Hall.  Why he should be called upon, he has no idea.  The Mayor will be speaking and so will the Archbishop of Canterbury.  They are forming a new battalion of the Buffs and want to fill it with local men.  Will Isabel help him with his speech?","Gabriel, Isabel, Dorothea"27-Aug-14,2,,Isabel says that she will do everything she can but she has a busy day herself.  Gabriel reminds her that she has a duty to him but she replies that she also has a duty to her country and St Jude's.,27-Aug-14,2,,"The conversation is interrupted by Dorothea's telephone call.  Gabriel answers crossly and passes it to Isabel, reminding her that it was only installed for his important council business.  Isabel listens as Dorothea explains the Marieke problem.  Seeing an immediate solution, she asks Gabriel if they could put up a Belgian mother and child for a few nights.  Gabriel, already out of sorts, is not prepared to have the disruption of a child in the house.  Isabel tells Dorothea she will come to St Jude's immediately to sort things out.",27-Aug-14,3,"The Vicarage, 9am","Esme is trying to cope with all the activity _ the telephone ringing, donations arriving for the dormitory, instructions from Dorothea about the Cake Sale and interference from Mrs Gibbons on the same subject.

Esme is immediately all apologies but Isabel is enormously sympathetic, which makes Esme warm to her even more.  Isabel tells Esme she has an idea which solve all their problems.",27-Aug-14,4,"The Church Hall, 9.15am.","Mathieu is still wailing.  Mrs Gibbons is giving MARIEKE a difficult time about it, despite Dorothea's increasingly firm interventions.  Clearly a row is building between Dorothea and Mrs Gibbons.","Marieke, Dorothea, Mrs Gibbons, Esme, Isabel"27-Aug-14,4,,"Isabel arrives from the Vicarage, with Esme in tow. Isabel has a proposition.  She asks Dorothea to take in Marieke at the Vicarage.  She has already considered the practicalities.  Marieke could either share with Esme or the box room could be made ready for both Marieke and the baby.  Marieke is an experienced housemaid, after all, and can soon be trained to Dorothea's ways.  ",27-Aug-14,4,,"When she realises that Dorothea is being offered what she perceives to be a ‚cheap servant', Mrs Gibbons offers her home as an alternative.  But seeing Marieke's dismay at that prospect, Dorothea agrees briskly to Isabel's proposal.",27-Aug-14,4,,Esme is not happy at the idea of sharing her room so is very helpful about reorganising the box room.,27-Aug-14,5,"The Graham House, 2pm","Gabriel is practising his speech for the Call To Arms meeting tonight and is annoyed to be interrupted by the phone ringing yet again.  This time it's RALPH, with the news that the first wounded arrived home quietly this morning.  More are expected this afternoon and quite a crowd is expected at the Harbour.  There are plans to make quite a fuss of ‚our boys' and it would be tremendous if Gabriel could be there to welcome them.  ","Gabriel, Ralph"27-Aug-14,6,"The Harbourside, 3.30.","A crowd has gathered, with a band, to welcome the returning wounded.  Ralph, Dorothea, Isabel and Mrs Gibbons have come down from St Jude's and are part of the crowd (helping us to dramatise the events).  Hillary joins them and we hear Gabriel at a distance giving a welcoming address.  We establish that the soldiers are not badly wounded but, as they are driven away to Shorncliffe Camp, Ralph comments that with the war news continuing to be bad and the BEF retreating, it won't be long before they will have to steel themselves for more serious casualties.","Gabriel, Ralph, Isabel, Dorothea, Mrs Gibbons"27-Aug-14,7,"The Vicarage, 7pm","Ralph and Dorothea are having dinner, with Esme serving, when they are disturbed by the cry of a wailing Mathieu.

It turns out that last night's Call To Arms meeting was not only a success but rather timely as Kitchener has this morning asked for another 100,000 volunteers.  And did she know that the Prime Minister was expected in Folkestone tomorrow.   Councillor Graham will be among the reception committee.","Hillary, Dorothea"28-Aug-14,1,,"Dorothea asks Hillary if he would ask Gabriel to invite the Prime Minister along to her Cake Sale, if he has time.  It has grown into a rather larger event than she had anticipated, with music and entertainments.  She'll ask Isabel to prevail on her father too.",28-Aug-14,1,,"But, of course, this is not what she has come to talk about.  Given the difficulties of the refugees finding their loved ones, and given that the newspaper is only published weekly, she has come up with an idea.  What does Hillary think of putting up a noticeboard outside the Town Hall where people could leave messages for one another?  A sort of Lost Property Office for people.",28-Aug-14,1,,Hillary not only thinks it's a good idea but quick and easy to put into practice.  He further suggests that Dorothea could speak to the Frosts.  Perhaps they could take photographs of people seeking their lost loved ones.  ,28-Aug-14,2,"The Wilson House, 5.30pm","VICTOR calls for KITTY to take her for a light supper before the theatre.

Then, says Victor, it is a good thing he came, isn't it?  His gentle manner causes Kitty to thaw a bit.  They set off together but she refuses his offer of an arm.  After all, it's just two people going for a bite to eat.

As soon as Esme thinks Marieke is ready, Dorothea will speak to her about it.  Esme is flattered to be entrusted with that responsibility.

Kitty is concerned that Victor is spending too lavishly but he reassures her that he has money and nobody to spend it on.  As they eat, Victor talks about friendship and respect.
