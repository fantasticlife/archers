Hillary takes the megaphone back and then hints that maybe Gabriel has too many commitments and perhaps the ballast that could be chucked from the balloon is his work for the council. He is interrupted with by screams from the on lookers. One of the oarsmen hasnêt resurfaced. Florrie and Kitty are concerned cos they know itês Jerry whoês sweet on Esme and he canêt swim. Frank runs to the end of the pier and without hesitation jumps in and pulls his brother to safety. Florrie says to Norman that she didnêt think Fisherman learnt to swim because they were superstitious. Norman says Frank learnt to try and compensate for his stutter.","Gabriel, Hillary, Florrie, Kitty, Norman",,,Frank becomes the hero of the hour.,,,,And the girl from the greengrocers shop has changed her mind and says she will now go out with him.,,,,And she has her photo taken with him by Kitty for the local paper.,10TH SEPTEMBER,WEDNESDAY ,,WATERY GRAVE?,,SCENE 1. ,INT.

Jerry had secured a charm in his boat that Esme gave him for good luck and despite the fact that it wasnêt lucky because the boat capsized and the likelihood is that it is no longer there but at the bottom of the sea, he so desperately wants it back that he wanted to go out and look for it but has been forbidden by Mrs Stone in case he gets pneumonia. So Frank and Norman have volunteered.","Norman, Frank, ",SCENE 3. ,INT. VICARAGE. NIGHT.,"Mathieu seems to be very distressed and, more worryingly notes Marieke, heês so weak he doesnêt even cry.

They notice something moving underneath the tarpaulin covering of another boat. They challenge who ever it is to come out with his hands up. Itês Dieter. A chase ensues from boat to boat with the Stone men desperately trying to get Dieter to give himself up. He wonêt and he jumps from boat to boat managing to evade them. When cornered he jumps to the harbour wall and tries to climb up it. They beg him to try and hold on they will rescue him but at that moment a huge wave comes and washes him off and out to sea. Norman and Frank try with the flashlights to locate him but without success. Frank wants to go in but Norman holds him back. Dieter fell outside the harbour wall. He wonêt stand a chance. Norman cannot lose Frank this way. He has done his bit for today. As itês not as if Dieter is his brother or even his countryman _ He is in fact the enemy.,"Norman, Frank, Dieter (?)",SCENE 5. ,INT.

Ralph goes to get the doctor a drop of whisky to keep out the night air before he makes his way home and Dorothea decides as Çneither she nor Mariekeê are Mathieuês mother, that he should sleep in the same bed as Dorothea and she, Dorothea should look after him from now on. Marieke protests that Dorothea has too much work _ what about the Franco-Belge newspaper, what about the parish work—?

Heês pointing to an advert for her parentsê bakery. She thinks he just wants to confirm that he knows her. So she says, Çyes, thatês our bakeryê you remember we got you a cake but you didnêt like it etc. He then gets some money out of his pocket but itês Belgian.

She faints. Jessie comes in for Adam. She finds Florrieês smelling salts and brings Kitty round.  Adam and Jessie are worried about leaving her alone. Kitty says sheês fine. She simply wonêt accept it. If heês dead thereêll be a body. Until his body is found she has decided not to believe heês dead. Thereês nothing to worry about, she reassures herself out loud. Adam and Jessie go.","Kitty, Adam, Jessie",SCENE 4.  ,EXT. STREET. CONT.,"Jessie asks Adam is something the matter with Kitty? He says, ÇYes. She just heard that her Beau has drownê. Jessie asks why are they called beaus? Adam doesnêt know but he says he once looked through a keyhole and he saw Kitty and Dieter with their arms and legs around each other looking like they were tied in knots so maybe thatês what it means - trying to tie yourself in a bow.","Jessie, Adam",,,Anyway Jessie didnêt mean that. She meant that Kitty looked quite fat. Adam hasnêt noticed but agrees that Kitty does like The Mooreês iced buns. ,,,,"I think we will have to call them something else, says Jessie.

Adam says he maybe he needs to change his money to pounds shillings and pence. ,,,,"They must find him and take him to a bank straight away insists Jessie. But Adam is worried about missing school. Jessie says by the time school finishes the banks will be shut. They should play hooky. Adamês anxious about the cane. They wonêt give you the cane, she reassures him. All you need to say is you had one of your turns. After you were stuck by lightening you can get away with anything. But what about you, he says, youêll get the ruler on your hand. She shrugs. Sheês had the ruler before. The worst thing is the humiliation of having it done in front of the class but after the first couple of times it doesnêt bother her. Come on.

She tells Adam to lure him away which Adam does and they all set off to the bank together but when they get there Henri doesnêt seem to want to change his money. He pats the top of their heads in a gentle gesture but then starts to cry. He shakes his head as if to apologise and wanders off. Norman Stone on the beat sees them and asks why they arenêt in school. Jessie says that they are upset because of Dieter and anyway they are learning from Çthe school of lifeê. Her dad says thatês much more use than sitting behind a desk doing your times tables. Stone says well it doesnêt matter as much for her. Sheêll leave school and have a family but Adam will have to get a job and provide for a family and the more schooling he gets the better paid his job. He tells her that Adam is a clever boy and she mustnêt lead him astray with her silly ideas.,"Adam, Jessie, (Henri), Norman",,,Adam apologises and says that they are on their way to school.

LUNCHTIME.,"Adam and Jessie are waiting for the dinner bell so they can slip into the playground with the other children, hopefully unnoticed. They sit on a bench to wait. Adam is looking up at the church. Jessie tells him the flag signalling doesnêt happen everyday. Adam says he was thinking about Sam and what sheês said about seeing him in heaven. He thinks soon they will know more people in heaven than on earth. They wonder if Dieter will go to heaven cos heês German. He will probably have to burn in the fires of hell.  Adam is upset. She tries to comfort him. He says heês not crying, looking up at the sun made his eyes water. Boys donêt cry. She says she knows and itês made her wonder about Laces. She has never seen a man cry. But Laces cries all the time. So maybe, this is her new theory - heês not a man. Maybe heês a woman. Adam thinks sheês mad but she reasons with him. Havenêt their parents told them that these people had to leave their home in what they stood up in? Didnêt they see old ladies just in their nightdresses and slippers getting off boats? Suppose Laces was asleep and jumped out of bed and put on the first things he or she could find i.e. her husbandês clothes and thatês why they think heês a man but whereas he could be a woman in menês clothes.","Adam, Jessie",,,This cheers Adam up. Adam laughs at her. Laces is not a woman. How stupid can she be? There is one sure way to tell and theyêve both seen it!  ,,,,Seen what?? ,,,,The size of his feet! They are whoppers! ,,,,"Thatês true she admits. They both start laughing but try to control it when Henri comes back up to them with the newspaper again. They still canêt understand what heês getting at. I know says Jessie letês take him into school and see if the teacher knows, cos she can do deaf and dumb language. Also she wonêt tell them off if they blame being late on Henri. Adam is happy to agree. As they walk into, Adam says to Jessie, ÇLook at his shoes.ê Yes, I know she says heês still got odd laces. Not that says Adam. The size of them! They could both have been used as boats in the Regatta!ê ",,,,Adam and Jessie try and suppress their giggles but canêt.

AM.,"Ernie, having made the bread for today, sits down to breakfast with Hilda and Jessie before going to catch up on his sleep. Jessie is their only child, their ray of sunshine, and very much loved by both of them. Unfortunately Norman Stone has told them of her backchat yesterday and they feel they have to tell her off about it. If sheêd been a boy Stone has told them heêd have boxed her ears. Thank goodness Iêm not she says and goes on to tell them she thinks sheês already a bit deaf mistaking Hun for bun. Despite their determination to tell her off she makes her parents laugh and her dad explains it comes from Attila the Hun who was a murdering, plundering monster. Sheês pleased that she now knows something that Çcleverê Adam doesnêt.","Ernie, Hilda, Jessie",2,INT. WILSON KITCHEN. AM.,"Adam, Florrie, Kitty and Jack are having breakfast when PC Stone arrives. Adam thinks itês about him and Jessie not being in school and starts to blurt things out causing a few raised eyebrows but itês nothing to do with that. So Adam sneaks out while he has the chance. Norman goes on to tells Albert, Florrie and Kitty that a body has been washed up along the coast but no one as yet has been able to identify it. Kitty faints again. Whist they bring her round there is some discussion as to who should identify it. Norman reminds them that itêll have been in the water for over a week so it wonêt be a pretty sight. Kitty insists it should be her but then passes out again. Jack absolutely forbids it. She has suffered enough. This will surely turn her insane. Albert says heêll go after his shift at work is over. Florrie panics. Someone else may have claimed him by then. The others look at her as if sheês lost her marbles. No one in their right mind would claim a body they didnêt know and have to pay funeral expenses. But Florrie thinks if thatês what it takes to convince Kitty Dieterês dead sheês prepared to do it. She canêt say this though and is simply insistent that she is the one with the time to go and identify the body. Being a woman they might not let her but she says in that case Albert can go after work.","Adam, Florrie, Kitty, Jack, Norman, Albert",3,INT. MOOREêS KITCHEN. AM.,"Pleased with her parentsê newfound good mood, Jessie feels confident to bring up the subject of Henri. She explains that Adam and she thought he was deaf and dumb and took him to her their teacher who can do sign language but it turns out he can hear but just canêt speak. They discovered that his name is Henri but his understanding of English isnêt so good. He can only understand Belch. This is what Jessie thinks Belgians speak. Again making her parents laugh. Her dadês says heêd understand either French or Flemish which is the Belgian language. Well, she said whatever it was he understood what her teacher was saying and then wrote down replies in his own language and guess what in his own country he is also a baker. Only itês called something like a pastry-in-the-air over there. She and Adam had thought he wanted to change his money at the bank but heêd being trying to tell them that heêd like to earn some money. Her parents are interested until Jessie outlines the plan that maybe Henri could come and work with Dad. Absolutely not, comes the reply. They do things differently over there. Our customers wouldnêt like it. He wouldnêt know one end of a spotted dick from another. Heês foreign and probably dirty. Jessie is told to drop the idea immediately and not ask again.","Jessie, Ernie, Hilda",4,EXT. STREET. AM.,"Meanwhile Adam has met Henri at the appointed time ready to introduce him to the bakery. Jessie runs out and tells them the bad news but Henri doesnêt understand what sheês saying. Adam is worried about how they will break the news to him. Jessie has a plan. Adam is to go in and distract her mum in the shop and she will smuggle Henri into the bakery at the back, set him to work and then bobs your uncle. Is she sure it will work. As sure as she is that Attila was the first Hun. ","Jessie, Adam, (Henri)",5,INT. PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIO. LUNCHTIME,Sidney and Lillian have gone to lunch when Florrie comes in having been to the morgue. Sheês pleased to find Kitty on her own. She has some bad news. It was Dieter.

But I knew him well enough to know it was him. ,,6,INT.  THE BAKERY. LUNCHTIME.,"Things have gone from bad to worse as far as Adam and Jessie are concerned. Henri has now put chocolate into his so-called bread. It didnêt even look like bread in the first place. It looks like an inedible, holy mess. Another good deed gone wrong, Jessie exclaims. Her parents are going to kill her. Hilda tries to come in but Jessie stalls her. She makes Adam sneak out and go into the shop because in doing so the bell rings. So Hilda has no option to go back into the shop.","Adam, Jessie, (Henri), Hilda",7,INT. WILSON HOUSE. PM.,"Florrie is putting the washing through the mangle when Kitty comes back in a rage. Kitty has been to the morgue. The body is not Dieter. How could her own mother lie to her like that? Florrie breaks down. Itês because she is her mother, because she loves her she wants to protect her. God knows this family has suffered enough. She can do nothing for Sam now but she is not going to lose another of her children even if it means breaking all Ten Commandments.","Florrie, Kitty",8,INT. BAKERS. PM.,Adam is worn out with having to open the door of the shop every time Hilda tires to investigate whatês happening out back. With some trepidation Adam and Jessie test Henriês product. They feel someone put a small piece of heaven in their mouths. They are delighted. Henri is delighted. Hilda comes in to find out what the commotion is about. Before she can tell them off Jessie persuades her to take a bit of the magic tasting bread. Hilda confirms that it is even better than a Bath Bun and that is her favourite. ,"Adam, Jessie, (Henri), Hilda",,,"Jessie is worried about what Ernie will say.

Heêd like her to take notes for him because he can no longer read his own writing.  Isabel insists that she needs some time to prepare for Sunday school.  Gabriel is incensed.  Itês only Monday.  Sheês has all week.  She says she wonêt be long.  Sheêd just like to spend sometime in the front room playing the piano.  Well it will have to wait Gabriel insists because surely she hasnêt forgotten but Blind Ned is coming to tune the piano today.

Well, letês just hope she doesnêt find anything as awful this week as she did last week when she took the washing out!

She stops playing, explains that she canêt use the piano at home as itês being tuned.  He apologises.  She says she thought she would be safe in that he, Ralph usually visits the sick on Monday mornings.  He says yes, heês just come in for his bits and pieces so he can administer Holy Communion.  Before they can say anything more they hear someone else come into the church and the sound of heavy boots on the flagstones.  It is PC Norman Stone on very important Police business.  He has reason to believe that there is a spy in the church and demands access to the roof.  Even though itês not locked Ralph insists on accompanying him.  If it is a spy it might take two of them to apprehend him.  He tells Isabel to go for her own safety.  But she insists on going with them.  She is not a wilting flower.  Besides thereês safety in numbers.","Ralph, Isabel, Norman",SCENE 7.  ,INT.  VICARAGE.  11.30.

He tells her he loves that hymn.  She tells him that it is a Sunday school favourite.  It reminds her of the simple message of the bible, which she teaches to children over and over - that God is love.  He agrees with her.  ","Ralph, Isabel, Marieke",,,"So she goes on to ask him, how then can love ever been wrong? Ralph says that the seventh commandment is ÇThou shall not commit adulteryê She points out that they havenêt.  After a pause he tells her that he has - in his heart.  They make a tentative move toward one another but before they can touch, Marieke bursts into the church screaming his name.

In broken English she explains that she wants to know if there is a way that the shop can take another photo of it, several in fact.  She needs to stick lots of posters up around town.  She needs to find this man.  Grief stricken Kitty is not in her right mind.  She says she does too, is he German? Ottoline is scared.  No, of course heês not.

TUESDAY 8.30AM ,"Gabriel is starting to behave increasingly oddly.  Over breakfast he launches an incoherent diatribe at Isabel about how Hillary is out to do him down, how just because thereês a war on things canêt slip, standards must be maintained but how can that be when there is now going to be Sunday opening.  First the Library, well that wasnêt so bad, he supposes because the devil finds work for idle hands.  But now theyêre going to be discussing the theatre.  The theatre with its allure of fornication, painted Jezebels and worse! And its director has been put in jail for £400 embezzlement.  Isabel is more concerned with the state of her piano.  Gabriel inadvertently kept moving the cups of tea made for Blind Ned who then, not being able to see where they were, knocked them over.  ","Gabriel, Isabel, Ralph",,,Ralph knocks at the door and Isabel immediately cheers up.  Ralph colludes with Gabriel about Sundays.  They should be kept as the Lordês Day and this calms Gabriel down.  But he remarks Ralphês made a rod for his own back with the curtailing of licensing hours.  A year from now theyêll be queuing up at the church for christenings.  Ralph says heês actually very fond of that service and asks if he might borrow Isabel for an hour or so.  Itês about starting up a Church War Christian Mission for children.  Prompted by PC Stone who told him that theyêve been making a nuisance of themselves.  (E.g.  Jessie and the flag incident),,,,"PC Stone can talk, retorts Gabriel thinking of Frank Stone - the wayward cucumber fraud.  Norman should look at his own children.  But when questioned, Gabriel wonêt be drawn further.  The job of a magistrate demands discretion.  He respects Ralph and so is happy to let Isabel help him but ask him not to keep her too long.  Ralph says that Hythe has a very good Childrenês mission and wonders if he could book the council car?

Victor has been to see Florrie and left another expensive present for Kitty.  Kitty is uninterested and Florrie becomes more insistent that she makes an effort to snap out of it.  But Kitty is becoming increasingly strange and vague about everything except Dieter and on that subject she is adamant that if he had died she would know.  She would feel it in her heart and soul.  Florrie reasons with her that if he wasnêt dead he would have got in touch to put her mind at rest.  However, since Florrie lied to her last week, Kitty wonêt now accept a thing she says.  She accuses her mother of being pleased heês gone because being German he was now an embarrassment.  Florrie says yes maybe but not nearly so much of an embarrassment, nay downright shame of having an unwed daughter in the family way.  Itês as though Kitty has forgotten all about being pregnant and when Florrie leaves sheês more worried about her daughter than ever.","Florrie, Kitty",SCENE 6.  ,EXT.  THE LEAS.  12.00 AM.,"Ralph and Isabel walk along the front.  She asks where they are going.  He says nowhere.  He just wanted to hear her voice and thinks that if they look as though they are purposefully walking towards the church no one will suspect anything and, being out in the open, they wonêt be tempted to do anything untoward.  She says that she didnêt think temptation per se was wrong _ only succumbing to it.  He laughs and asks her if she studied Theology at university too.  Florrie catches up with them.  She begs to have a word with Ralph.  Isabel says sheêll go on to the church hall.  But Florrie insists she stay.  She has something to ask them and itês difficult.  It involves one of her children.  Ralph and Isabel fear the worst.  Has Adam told Florrie about the lightening kiss? But no she tells them about Kitty and how she wonêt accept the death of Dieter.  There is an exchange the sub-text of which is that itês difficult to let go of someone you love whatever the circumstances.  Ralph then says it is very difficult to believe someone has died if you do not see the body and says if it will help, he will do a little sort of informal but obviously not proper funeral service by the water.  Florrie thinks this is a very good idea wants it to be as soon as possible.  It might help Kitty to be able to say good bye.  He suggests tomorrow.  Florrie thanks him and asks for reassurance that it isnêt treason to say a fond farewell to a German.  When Florrieês gone, Isabel questions Ralph.  Doesnêt he have a prayer meeting tomorrow evening? He says yes but heês sure he can do both or leave the curate in charge of the prayer meeting.  He tells her he didnêt want to agree to do it on Thursday because thatês his day off and he was thinking of taking that trip to Hythe where they have a Childrenês mission, he thought he would ask them about it and was wondering if sheêd like to accompany him?","Ralph, Isabel, Florrie"17TH SEPTEMBER,WEDNESDAY ,,,,1,INT.

Adam says would it be alright with her if - while the vicar was talking about Dieter - he Adam could think about Sam because he didnêt get to go to Samês funeral either.  She says she doesnêt care what he thinks about and would he stop fiddling about and go.  Heês making the shop look untidy.  He is about to go when he sees the photo of Henri and becomes very excited.  Where did she get it? She explains a woman came in saying it was her husband but Kitty didnêt know any more than that, not his name, not her name, nothing.  Adam wants to take the photo and show Henri but Kitty says the woman is coming back that day and he canêt have it.  He says heêll mind the shop if sheêll go and get Jessie.  Kitty refuses.  He says that heêll have to wait in the shop until she arrives and take her to Henri.  Kitty says that they only have the womanês word heês her husband.  Maybe sheês come to make trouble.  Adam thinks that could be possible.  Then he arrives at a solution.  Heêll make a drawing of the photo and take it to Henri first.  Kitty points out that thereês no point in making a drawing of the photo.  Itês definitely Henri.  Adam should go and find him and ask him is his wife a stout woman with brown hair.  If she is he should come to the photographersê studio.  Adam rushes off.  Florrie comes in.  She confides that she thinks Adams too young to come to the service for Dieter but Kitty says that they should let him.  All things considered sheês surprised Florrie didnêt lie about Samês death as well.  This is too close to the mark for Florrie.  She leaves stung.","Adam, Kitty, Florrie",SCENE 4.  ,INT.

Boys cleverer than girls the very idea but her gloating is interrupted when Ottoline comes up to them and asks Adam where he got the pastry? He, still in good deed mood, offers her a bite.  No, she says she wonders who made it? Jessie and Adam look at her and realise.  They shout in unison HENRI! Ottoline is overjoyed.

The watch committee meets tonight.  The Reverend Winwood needs to be back for it.  There is going to be a deputation opposing the move for the Playhouse to open on Sunday nights to keep the troops entertained.  There are considerable concerns over the observance of Sunday and worries about men and women shut up in a dimly lit theatre.

Ralph laughs.,"Ralph, Isabel, Dorothea",,,"Suddenly, seemingly from nowhere, Dorothea is behind them with Mathew in the pram.  They are taken aback.  She takes their shock to be the surprise at seeing her out with Mathew so soon after his illness.  She explains that Dr Mcfee had been to see how he was doing and heêd told her that fresh air would do Mathew the world of good.  Dorothea says how pleased she is that Isabel is helping Ralph.  Heês been over-doing it lately and waves them off with her blessing.  ",,3,EXT.  LEAS.  3.00PM.,Victor asks Kitty to take tea with him in The Metropoleês Palm Court.

No, she says thereês something else but she canêt tell him here.  He says he knows that too.  She is flabbergasted.  He knows that and he still wants to marry her? Yes, that is why heês rushing things before other people realise _ which wonêt be long _ and start pointing fingers.  But she still canêt believe it.  He assures her he thinks itês a bit like buying a house and then finding out itês got a sitting tenant.

Ralph has thought things through.  Heês never felt happier than he does with Isabel.  So this must be right.  He confesses to her that he and Dorothea have never slept in the room never mind the same bed.  They have no knowledge of each other in the biblical sense.  So strictly speaking his love for Isabel isnêt adulterous, as his marriage has never been consummated.  And maybe Isabel was right and Dorothea does know what they feel for each other.  He resolves to tell Dorothea tomorrow about Isabel and he deludedly talks himself into thinking that maybe it will be a relief for her to let him go.","Ralph, Isabel"19TH SEPTEMBER,FRIDAY ,,,,SCENE 1.  ,INT: WILSONêS KITCHEN.,Florrie tells Kitty she needs now to forget Dieter and concentrate on Victor.

So heêll probably be sent to prison.  Kitty softens.  She tells him that unless Dieter gave him anything in return it wasnêt trading.  Then she goes on to confide that Victor has asked her to marry him but she doesnêt know what to do.  She doesnêt really feel happy about it.  Adam says he doesnêt feel happy, not in the same way he did when Sam was still here.  That nothing is the same since Sam died.  And sometimes when he feels happy, he feels bad about it.  Heês had some funny times with Jessie.  Then he thinks how much Sam would have enjoyed it and is sad.  But just cos heês not here Sam wouldnêt want Adam not to enjoy it.  Kitty says.  Then thanks her and then, meaning it kindly, he says he canêt understand why sheês getting so fat as she never seems to eat anything.  This is food for thought.

He knows heês a terrible coward itês just— She puts her finger to his lips and says sheês relieved.  She has to stay with her father.  His sanity is not up to snuff (Or 1914 phrase meaning the same). She doesnêt want to be responsible for destroying their respective families more than the Germans ever could.  They agree reluctantly to keep things under wraps.  Both are upset.  Maybe itês part of Godês plan that we should live with the wrong people thinks Isabel.  Gabriel, wanting attention, bangs his stick on the floor above.  Isabel lets out a cry of frustration.

Their new lodgings are fine, lovely (very slight hint of uneasiness in Ottolineês voice). She says they wondered, well she was wondering, if it would be a good idea if she and Henri had a party. Would Hillary mind? Is it a proper time to have a party with so much trouble? Hilda thinks this is a great idea and says she and Ernie can help them to organize it. They can bake all kinds of goodies specially. It can be an English/Belgian evening.

Evening.,"Dorothea explains to Esme that Marieke taking Mathew out this morning was very concerning, and while she understands Marieke is very fond of Mathew she is going to have to accept, as hard as it may be, that Dorothea is virtually his mother now. Dorothea tells Esme this is why she has decided to take Mathew into her own room especially at night in order to help Marieke begin to distance herself a little from him. Itês clear Marieke is far too attached for her own good and for Mathewês, so that will have to be addressed over the coming weeks.

She explains it might be better if Marieke spent a bit more of her time there, after all sheêll be mixing with other Belgians and that canêt be a bad thing. Ralph wonders if she isnêt being a bit too heavy with Marieke since clearly the girl likes being with Mathew. Dorothea says she is only being cruel to be kind.

After all sheês just as famous for her vandalism as she is for her views and even they are questionable.

Ralph argues that if she really believed in equality sheêd be demanding that women signed up as well. Ralph realizes he is getting a bit carried away and apologizes saying heês already given Isabel an earful.

He references Isabel and how Dorothea is abandoning her to the refugee work. Dorothea is thrown by yet another reference to Isabel and denies any such thing.

Dorothea lightly questions how Isabel knows how Ralph feels about this. Isabel dissembles awkwardly by saying Ralph must have said something about it at some time, she canêt be sure when. Dorothea is more curious about this but opts to let it go, itês something and nothing whatever sheês thinking. Sensing somethingês bothering Dorothea Isabel asks if everything is alright?

Gabriel says this is typical, a typical woman, canêt even be on time for her own talk.","Hillary, Gabriel",Scene 8,,"Florrie brings Kitty in and shows her her own wedding dress. Kitty can wear this for her wedding. Kitty is emotional. Florrie says she has another little something here— some brandy— for medicinal and special occasions only. Florrie goes to call Esme from the other room and tells Kitty ÇThat Pankhurst woman can have all the equality she wants but weêve got more than enough of it here, so letês drink a toast to you and Victor and your wedding and your little baby to be, and to us.. to us womenê. And she calls Esme again. Kitty tells her Mum how much she loves her. Florrie tells her to keep that dress safe for her sister when sheês getting wed.","Florrie, Kitty, Esme",Scene 9,Int. Town Hall. Evening,"Gabriel/Isabel/Ralph/Dorothea (and Lillian though we donêt have the actor) are being  introduced to Pankhurst by Hillary. Pankhurst is polite and deferential... ÇA pleasant tripê, ÇTerrible timesê, ÇDelayed by the trainsê etc etc. But Pankhurst gives all her attention to praising Dorotheaês/Isabelês/ refugee work, how difficult it must be for Dorothea being the Vicarês wife as well, all those onerous duties, and sheês taken on a child now! Itês that kind of work that will make all the difference to the cause! ","Gabriel, Isabel, Ralph, Dorothea, Pankhurst",,,"The men can hardly get a word in. As Pankhurst moves away Gabriel comments disparagingly, the men generally agree with his sentiments. They women  comment on how small and gentle and quiet-spoken Pankhurst is for someone with such a fearsome reputation.",,,,"Hillary moves up to introduce Pankhurst. She launches into a brilliantly rousing jingoistic speech (Ref Emmiline Pankhurst by Paula Bartley for samples of speeches she gave on this tour) and has the audience in her hands from the off, winning rounds of  applause. Gabriel can only stutter ÇMy Godê and Ralph echo his sentiments with ÇIndeed, Indeed, My— God.ê",29-Sep,Monday ,,,,Scene 1,Wilson Household,Kitty is trying on her wedding dress and itês a squeeze. Itês borrowed from another girl. Another girl who wasnêt nearly so far gone as Kitty. Florrie is trying to work out how to put another panel into the bodice so that Kitty can still breathe.

The Reverend Winwood tells Adam that there will be a storm on Thursday so they must both be careful that they donêt get hit by lightning.  This gives Adam an idea. Will there definitely be lightening then? The Reverend says he doesnêt know. That he was only joking and perhaps he shouldnêt joke about such things. Since there was nothing funny about it the first time around.  ,"Adam, Ralph",Scene3,Wilson Household,Kitty wants to wear a black arm band with her wedding dress. A black armband for Dieter. Florrie says she canêt. That this is ridiculous. What will anyone think of a woman in a wedding dress with a black armband. This is a wedding not a funeral and besides itês men who wear arm bands not women. Victor calls at the house and is told he canêt see the dress as itês bad luck. Kitty doesnêt think it will make much difference.,"Kitty, Florrie, Victor",Scene 4,The Leas,Victor and Kitty go for a walk along the seafront.

Dorothea tells Ralph she has never been happier in her life. ,"Dorothea, Ralph"October,Wednesday ,,,,Scene 1,Graham household,We see Isabel taking care of her father Councillor Graham.

All of them says Councillor Graham.  Hillary calls at the house to see how Graham is doing. Isabel asks Hillary if he will stay with the Councillor while she goes for a walk. She goes out. Down to the sea. Goes to the pier. A soldier tries to talk to her. To chat her up. She goes along with it. Perhaps she even kisses him. Miss Graham kissing a common soldier on the pier for all to see. Kissing the soldier is not like kissing Reverend Winwood.,"Isabel, Gabriel, Hillary",Scene 2,Graham household.,Isabel comes home and tells her father that they are going out tonight. They are going to the theatre. ,"Isabel, Gabriel",Scene 3,Theatre,Isabel and Ralph are each sat in a box on opposite sides of the auditorium. Dorothea sees that Ralph isnêt watching the show.

So she wears black stockings. ,"Adam, Esme, Kitty",Scene2,Church,Victor places ring on Kittyês hand. She bursts into tear. Florrie says to everyone _ donêt worry _ theyêre tears of joy. No one is convinced. Least of all Victor. At the end of the ceremony Adam slips away and climbs the bell tower. ,"Victor, Kitty, Florrie, Adam",Scene 3,Bell Tower. ,On exiting the church Kitty screams when she spots Adam at the top of the bell tower. Rev Winwood hurries up the steps of the tower. What is Adam doing? Adam says he is trying to get hit by lightning. Adam is trying to swap himself for Sam. Ralph thinks this is a noble idea but somewhat flawed.,"Kitty, Adam, Ralph",,,Ralph and Adam remain at the top of the bell tower for some time. The Vicar admits to Adam that he lied. That the Vicar did kiss Miss Graham and that heês in a mess and doesnêt know what to do. That it was the best kiss of his life. And Adam says well at least you didnêt start the war. What is Adam talking about? We and the Reverend find out that what haunts Adam is the idea that inside the parcel was a gun. The very gun that shot the Archduke Ferdinand. That this how Adam thinks he started the war. Ralph happily explains that the parcel was unlikely to be a gun and even if it was a gun it wasnêt the one that shot the Archduke because he was shot by Serbians not Germans. They stay sitting. Watching the rain.,03-Oct,Friday ,,,,Scene 1,Grand Hotel,An awkward morning after for Kitty and Victor in their hotel room. It is strange for Kitty to wake up in the hotel. The hotel where Dieter worked. She feels like a fraud. Or a lady pretending to be grand. Victor says that when his Aunt Phyllis dies they will be able to stay in hotels like this again. That they will be quite well off in fact and wonêt that be something?  Victor hopes that they can be like a real married couple one day. Kitty says of course. Victor understands that she is pregnant. But after the baby. When the baby is born. It will be different then wonêt it. ,"Kitty, Victor",Scene 2,Wilson Household,A letter arrives for Kitty.

Victor confesses to Kitty that he is afraid. She kisses him. He gets on the boat. Kitty cries now. Now that heês gone. Adam takes her hand. Offers to buy her an ice cream. In October? ,"Kitty, Victor, Adam",Scene 4,Seafront,Kitty and Adam eat ice cream. Even though itês cold.
