The interior of the ship is dimensionally transcendental, which means that it is bigger on the inside than the outside. A fully operational TARDIS has a chameleon circuit that allows the exterior of the ship to change form and to blend in with its surroundings. However, on a visit to [London](/places/wdxm), the chameleon circuit of the Doctor\'s TARDIS malfunctioned and the exterior has remained stuck in the shape of an old fashioned police telephone box ever since.\r\n\r\nThe design and layout of the interior of the TARDIS has frequently changed over the many years that the Doctor has been travelling in it. In one form or another though, it has always had a main control room, known as the Console Room, from which the ship can be operated. However, the Doctor\'s ability to accurately direct the flight of his ship has often been rather hit-and-miss.

The [Fifth Doctor](/characters/mrzf)\'s sonic screwdriver was destroyed by a blast from a Tereleptil\'s gun and he did not acquire a new model until late in his [Seventh Incarnation](/characters/cgf9).

However, the Doctor has suggested that it might be possible for him to construct a new key if necessary. \r\n\r\nOver the many years of the Doctor\'s travels in his TARDIS, the key has taken on different forms. It has most often resembled a standard Yale key as would probably have been used to open the door of a real police telephone box. However, despite its appearance, the key is the product of highly sophisticated [Time Lord](/groups/d325) technology.\r\n\r\nThe key has been seen to glow and become warm when the TARDIS is about to materialise in its vicinity. The Doctor has, on occasions, used his TARDIS key to gain access to another Time Lord\'s TARDIS such as the Rani\'s.\r\n',2,'2010-01-08 11:31:45','2010-01-25 13:46:58','Opens the door of the TARDIS'),(15,'DVD','[Larry Nightingale](/characters/w963) and other DVD enthusiasts have discovered that a hidden extra, known as an Easter Egg, has been placed on seventeen DVDs.

Jack used the hand as a way to detect the Doctor as it would glow whenever the Doctor was in the vicinity. When Jack joined the Doctor in the [TARDIS](/things/n84h) once again, he brought the hand with him.\r\n\r\nThe hand, along with the TARDIS, was captured by the Master who used the hand to extract the Doctor\'s biological code and aged the Doctor by a hundred years.\r\n\r\nFollowing this, the hand remained in the TARDIS. When the Doctor was shot by a [Dalek](/groups/284h), he managed to avoid full regeneration by re-directing the excess regenerative energy into the hand.

Barbara and Susan join forces with human freedom fighters who are determined to take back their world.\r\n\r\nThe Dalek saucer takes the Doctor and Ian to the centre of Dalek operations in Bedfordshire.  There the Doctor discovers the Dalek’s incredible plan to mine out the Earth’s core and replace it with a device that will allow them to pilot the entire planet through space like a giant starship.\r\n','2010-01-14 10:39:13','2010-01-29 10:11:00','',8),(8,'Daleks in Manhattan / Evolution of the Daleks','In 1930\'s New York, the Cult of Skaro are creating a new race of humanoid Daleks.','The TARDIS takes the Doctor and Martha to New York in 1930 where the Empire State Building is under construction.  There they discover that the Daleks are abducting the homeless.

The Daleks use a gamma lightening strike to transform their prisoners into human Daleks. But the Doctor has introduced his own DNA into the hybrids and they rebel against the Daleks.

There the Doctor and Martha meet Solomon,  the leader of of the community  of the homeless. Solomon reveals that people have been going missing at night.\r\n\r\nAt the Empire State Building, Mr Diagoras is overseeing construction but is secretly in the employ of the four Daleks who make up the Cult of Skaro. The Daleks are responsible for the abductions, some of whom are surgically altered into pig-like slaves while the others are reserved for ‘the final experiment’.\r\nDiagoras recruits workers, including the Doctor and Martha. Taken to the sewers,  the Doctor’s group are chased by the pig slaves but manage to escape.  \r\n\r\nDespite the objections of fellow Daleks, Caan, Thay and Jast, Dalek Sec is determined to become the first of a new race of Dalek/Human hybrids. To this end, Sec absorbs Diagoras and metamorphoses into the first human Dalek.\r\nSec’s final experiment is to transform the captive humans into Daleks by using the energy from a gamma strike which will be conducted from the mast of the Empire State Building. Dalek Caan and the other two Daleks exterminate Sec, believing that he is no longer a true Dalek.  They alter the experiment so that the humans will become totally Dalek. \r\n\r\nDespite his efforts, the Doctor is unable to prevent the gamma strike but manages to introduce his own DNA into the new human Daleks. Refusing to take orders from their Dalek masters , the human Daleks rebel, destroying Jast and Thay. Dalek Caan is the only surviving Dalek and escapes using emergency time shift.\r\n',7);
