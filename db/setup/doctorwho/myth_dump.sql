The name TARDIS was invented by the [Doctor](/characters/m2qv)\'s granddaughter, Susan who created the acronym from the initials Time and Relative Dimension in Space. \r\n\r\nThe Doctor\'s TARDIS is a now obsolete Type 40 model. The interior of the ship is dimensionally transcendental, which means that it is bigger on the inside than the outside. A fully operational TARDIS has a chameleon circuit that allows the exterior of the ship to change form and to blend in with its surroundings. However, on a visit to [London](/places/wdxm), the chameleon circuit of the Doctor\'s TARDIS malfunctioned and the exterior has remained stuck in the shape of an old fashioned police telephone box ever since.\r\n\r\nThe design and layout of the interior of the TARDIS has frequently changed over the many years that the Doctor has been travelling in it. In one form or another though, it has always had a main control room, known as the Console Room, from which the ship can be operated. However, the Doctor\'s ability to accurately direct the flight of his ship has often been rather hit-and-miss. Amongst other rooms and facilities, the TARDIS also has a large wardrobe, a swimming pool, a laboratory, a zero room, bedrooms, cloisters and a food machine.',2,'2009-11-19 10:49:20','2010-01-25 13:30:23','Picture_27.png','image/png',658449,'2010-01-04 15:03:49','The Doctor\'s time/space vehicle'),(5,'qvcz','The Doctor\'s Message','A message scrawled on the wall of the [house at West Drumlins](/places/96p2) in large black letters.

The [Fifth Doctor](/characters/mrzf)\'s sonic screwdriver was destroyed by a blast from a Tereleptil\'s gun and he did not acquire a new model until late in his [Seventh Incarnation](/characters/cgf9).

It has most often resembled a standard Yale key as would probably have been used to open the door of a real police telephone box. However, despite its appearance, the key is the product of highly sophisticated [Time Lord](/groups/d325) technology.\r\n\r\nThe key has been seen to glow and become warm when the TARDIS is about to materialise in its vicinity.

Jack used the hand as a way to detect the Doctor as it would glow whenever the Doctor was in the vicinity. When Jack joined the Doctor in the [TARDIS](/things/n84h) once again, he brought the hand with him.\r\n\r\nThe hand, along with the TARDIS, was captured by the Master who used the hand to extract the Doctor\'s biological code and aged the Doctor by a hundred years.\r\n\r\nFollowing this, the hand remained in the TARDIS. When the Doctor was shot by a [Dalek](/groups/284h), he managed to avoid full regeneration by re-directing the excess regenerative energy into the hand.

Having deduced that years of radioactive contamination and chemical warfare will eventually lead to the mutation of the Kaleds into helpless organisms, Davros has created the Mark 3 Travel Machine.

Davros takes the opportunity to release his Daleks who ruthlessly crush any resistance from the Thals and the surviving Kaleds. \r\n\r\nUnable to bring himself to completely destroy the Daleks, the Doctor seals them in their bunker along with their creator. Too late, Davros realises that the Daleks consider even him expendable and they exterminate him.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, Sarah and Harry depart Skaro by using a Time Lord [time ring](http://myth.rad0.net/things/b2qv).
