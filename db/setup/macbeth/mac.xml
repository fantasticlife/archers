                    <title>The WordHoard Shakespeare</title>
          is a joint project of the Perseus Project at Tufts University, The Northwestern University Library, and Northwestern University Academic Technologies. It is derived from
          <title>The Globe Shakespeare</title>
          , the one-volume version of the
          <title>Cambridge Shakespeare</title>
          , edited by W. G. Clark, J. Glover, and W. A. Wright (1891-3). The
          <title>Internet Shakespeare</title>
          editions of the quartos and folios have been consulted to create a modern text that observes as closely as possible the morphological and prosodic practices of the earliest editions. Spellings, especially of contracted and hyphenated forms, have been standardized across the corpus. The text has been fully lemmatized and morphosyntactically tagged.
